Quick Usage Overview
-----------------------------------------------

Install Solr (packages available for most OSes)
* For demonstration and testing purposes, a standalone Jetty based installation
  of solr is available in the solr/ subdirectory. To execute, simply change
  to that directory and run java -jar start.jar - the default settings will
  be fine for evaluation. 

Add the SolrSearchable decorator to any DataObjects you want to search (for example, SiteTree and File)

Use SolrSearchForm instead of SearchForm.

API
-----------------------------------------------

By default, the indexing mechanism uses the SolrSchemaMapper class as the 
mechanism for mapping between silverstripe DataObjects and items that can 
be stored in a Solr Schema. If you are using the default schema.xml for solr, 
then you only have a few data types you can play with, which explains why
the default mapper class only indexes a few properties. 

To improve this, or be more specific with how things are stored, you'll 
need to provide your own implementation that expands on some of the
information stored - more details on how exactly to do this will be
provided at a later point in time
