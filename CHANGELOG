2011-07-12 v0.4.0
-----------------

* Users can configure solr indexing from the "Solr" section of the admin 
  interface. Select the page type, then select which fields should be indexed
  for that type
* Updated the schema.xml to allow for a 'multitext' type which provides for 
  case insensitive searching
* Introduced the ability to boost certain fields in searches
* Added dismax option for search 

2011-07-11 v0.3.5
-----------------

* Indexing of content uses the queuedjobs module if available to process
  the actual indexing of an individual item. Uses the immediate mode jobs
  so that the indexing happens straight away. 

2011-05-27 v0.3.4
-----------------

* Added ability to specify which fields will be searched on by default
  when a user performs a query

2011-03-31 v0.3.3
-----------------

* Fixed issue where empty strings in facet results were being passed through
  as _empty_

2011-03-08 v0.3.2
-----------------

* Fixed error caused by unpublish failing if solr has gone away

2011-02-03 v0.3.1
-----------------

* Fixed declaration of reindex job to detect queuedjob module existence first

2010-10-26 v0.3.0
-----------------

* Added ability to query against both Live and Draft data sources. If an 
  object is versionable, it will be indexed with either Live or Stage, 
  depending on whether it is written or published. For non-versioned content, 
  it is actually indexed with BOTH stages, indicating that it is relevant for 
  a search in either stage"

 
2010-10-21 v0.2.1
-----------------

* Fixed bug where associativity precedence in query syntax stopped pages 
  being found by 'title' 


2010-06-21 v0.2.0
-----------------

* Better interface for searching by providing a complete 'SearchPage' 
  implementation
* Added support for faceting
* Added support for queueing reindexing to reduce user wait time (if the 
  QueuedJobs module is installed)
