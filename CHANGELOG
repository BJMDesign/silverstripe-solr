Version 0.3.0
2010-10-26
-------------

* Added ability to query against both Live and Draft data sources. If an 
  object is versionable, it will be indexed with either Live or Stage, 
  depending on whether it is written or published. For non-versioned content, 
  it is actually indexed with BOTH stages, indicating that it is relevant for 
  a search in either stage"

 
Version 0.2.1
2010-10-21
-------------

* Fixed bug where associativity precedence in query syntax stopped pages 
  being found by 'title' 


Version 0.2.0
-------------

* Better interface for searching by providing a complete 'SearchPage' 
  implementation
* Added support for faceting
* Added support for queueing reindexing to reduce user wait time (if the 
  QueuedJobs module is installed)
